Offset the scroll position of anchored links. Handy if you have a sticky header that covers linked material.

== Description ==

Often anchor links can be overachievers and can scroll a user past the section intended. This plugin attempts to change that by offering a setting that allows you to change the scroll offset when clicking anchors. It also adds a nice animated scrolling effect when clicking an anchor rather than the sudden jump that usually occurs. Even handles when visiting a hashed URL directly.

Use the `no-scroll` class on any hash links that are not meant to scroll to an area of the page (Navigation for sliders, etc).

== Installation ==

= Manual Installation =

1. Upload the entire `/hash-link-scroll-offset` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate Hash Link Scroll Offset through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Update the "Hash Link Scroll Offset" setting on the general settings page, **http://YOURSITE.COM/wp-admin/options-general.php**.
